# Getting Updates

Two mutually exclusive approaches to receive updates from Telegram: long polling or webhooks. You must use one or the other — never both simultaneously.

## Quick Reference

| Need to... | Key Method(s) | File |
|------------|---------------|------|
| Poll for updates | getUpdates | polling.md |
| Receive push updates | setWebhook, deleteWebhook, getWebhookInfo | webhooks.md |
